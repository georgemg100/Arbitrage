     * Pool hooks (where applicable). Calls to `registerTokens` and `deregisterTokens` may change this order.

     * If a Pool only registers tokens once, and these are sorted in ascending order, they will be stored in the same
     * order as passed to `registerTokens`.
     *
     * Total balances include both tokens held by the Vault and those withdrawn by the Pool's Asset Managers. These are
     * the amounts used by joins, exits and swaps. For a detailed breakdown of token balances, use `getPoolTokenInfo`
     * instead.
